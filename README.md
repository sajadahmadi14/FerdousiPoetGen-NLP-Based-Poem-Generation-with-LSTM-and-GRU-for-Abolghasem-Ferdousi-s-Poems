# FerdousiPoetGen-NLP-Based-Poem-Generation-with-LSTM-and-GRU-for-Abolghasem-Ferdousi-s-Poems

A sequence to sequence model that uses deep neural networks and NLP techniques to generate new poems based on existing ones. Specifically, the model architecture consists of Encoder-Decoder units with LSTM and GRU cells, which are trained on Abolghasem Ferdousi's poems dataset using the teacher forcing method.

The first step in the process is to implement the sequence to sequence model using LSTMs and train it on the Ferdousi's poems dataset. The accuracy and error diagrams are then drawn for the LSTM model, providing insights into its performance during training.

Next, the model is updated to use bilaterally connected GRU cells as Encoder-Decoder units and is trained again on the same dataset using teacher forcing. The accuracy and error diagrams for the GRU model are also generated, allowing researchers and developers to compare the performance of the two models and make informed decisions about which one to use.

The trained models can then be used to generate new poems from Abolghasem Ferdousi or other poets, demonstrating the ability of the sequence to sequence model to capture the unique linguistic patterns and styles found in their poetry. This makes the GitHub repository a valuable resource for those interested in generative text models, particularly in the field of poetry generation.

Overall, this GitHub repository provides a useful tool for researchers and developers working on NLP and deep learning projects, allowing them to explore the potential of sequence to sequence models using LSTM and GRU cells for generating new poems from existing ones.
